/**
 * A model which can be augmented with custom key-value pairs of information
 * that are not part of the canonical introspection model. We call this pairs
 * {@code model properties}.
 * <p/>
 * This is useful for pieces of metadata which might not apply to all extensions
 * or might be specific to a particular implementations.
 * <p/>
 * Examples of a model property are the namespace URI and schema version for extensions
 * that support XML configuration, vendor specific information, custom policies, etc.
 * <p/>
 * The values added as model properties can be of any types, from simple types such as
 * {@link String}, {@link Long}, etc to complex types such as pojos or java beans. When
 * complex types are used, those should be immutable. This is because if a model definition
 * keeps changing the runtime behaviour could become inconsistent. It should also be thread-safe
 * since several threads should be able to query the model safely.
