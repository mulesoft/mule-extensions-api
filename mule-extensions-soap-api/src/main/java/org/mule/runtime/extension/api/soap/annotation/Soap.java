 * A key difference between traditional extensions and Soap based extensions is that the @Extension annotated class does not
 * serve as a configuration, but it can serve as {@link SoapServiceProvider} by implementing it.
 * <p>
 * {@link Soap} cannot live with the @Configurations or @ConnectionProviders annotations, once the @Extension is marked a Soap
 * one, no other Configs or Providers could be declared.
