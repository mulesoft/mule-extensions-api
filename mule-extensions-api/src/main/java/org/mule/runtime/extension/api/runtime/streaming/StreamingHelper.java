/**
 * This class provides helper methods to deal with repeatable streaming resources which are contained into structures of
 * arbitrary complexity.
 * <p>
 * As you know, when a parameter is resolved to a {@link CursorProvider}, the runtime automatically obtains a {@link Cursor}
 * and injects that value instead. However, if that provider is embedded as the value of a {@link Map} or an arbitrary pojo,
 * the runtime can't guess that's the case and go resolve it.
 * <p>
 * Same thing applies when a component is producing a result. The runtime automatically converts returned {@link InputStream}
 * or {@link PagingProvider} instances into {@link CursorProvider} ones. However, if such instances are contained in some other
 * value, that resolution won't happen automatically either.
 * <p>
 * For these border cases, this class provides some utilities to adapt the {@link CursorProvider providers} into
 * {@link Cursor cursors} and vice versa
 *
