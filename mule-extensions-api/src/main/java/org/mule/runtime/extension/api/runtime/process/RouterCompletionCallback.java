/**
 * This callback is how a Router receiving {@link Route}s notify their outcome.
 * <p>
 * In order to implement a Router (that is, an operation that receives one or more {@link Route}s), the method needs to:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Have a void return type</li>
 * <li>Have at least one argument of {@link Route} type</li>
 * <li>Have an argument of {@link RouterCompletionCallback} type</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When the execution of the Router has finished, it has to notify the {@link Result} either by invoking
 * the {@link #success(Result)} or {@link #error(Throwable)} methods.
 * Only then will the execution of the Router be considered as completed and the next processor in the
 * pipeline will be executed.
 * <b>If the {@link #success(Result)} or {@link #error(Throwable)} methods are invoked before any of the nested {@link Route}s
 * is completed, the {@link Result} of the nested execution will be lost and never propagated.</b>
 *
 * For example, a Router can be declared as:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * public void twoRoutesRouter(WhenRoute when, @Optional OtherwiseRoute other, RouterCompletionCallback callback) {
 *    if (when.shouldExecute()) {
 *        when.getChain().process(routeResult -> callback.success(routeResult), (e, r) -> callback.error(e));
 *    } else if (other != null && other.shouldExecute()) {
 *        other.getChain().process(callback::success, (e, r) -> callback.error(e));
 *    } else {
 *        callback.error(new IllegalArgumentException("No route could be executed"));
 *    }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 *
 * @since 1.0
