/**
 * A parameter type which allows to get values as they were provided in the DSL,
 * preventing the runtime from resolving expressions or applying any transformations. This is useful
 * when such evaluation should be delegated into a third party.
 * <p>
 * In the particular case of configurations and connection providers, using literal parameters
 * allows that configuration to be treated as a static one instead of dynamic. This is so because
 * the literal value is constant, even if that literal is actually an expression. Because the runtime
 * won't be evaluating it automatically, it's an static value, from the extension's point of view.
 * <p>
 * If the value was provided as an expression, this class will provide such expression but
 * will offer no way to actually evaluate it. Use {@link ParameterResolver} for that.
 *
 * Finally, a super important consideration to have is the generic type. The {@link ParameterModel} derived
 * from uses of this interface will have its type set according to the generic type. The generic is not optional
 * <p>
 * @param <T> the generic type of the actual parameter type
 *           @since 1.0
