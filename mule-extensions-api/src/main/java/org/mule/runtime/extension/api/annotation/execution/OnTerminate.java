/**
 * Used to indicate that an annotated method should be executed when a given
 * execution finishes.
 *
 * The actual meaning of the term 'given execution' depends of the context in which
 * this annotation is used. For example, if used in a {@link Source} type, it means
 * that the annotated method should be executed when a generated event was processed
 * by the owning flow doesn't taking in account if the processing finished successfully or not.
 *
 * For {@link Source sources} the unique parameters which this callback can receive are
 * the {@link OnTerminateResult} and the {@link SourceCallbackContext}
