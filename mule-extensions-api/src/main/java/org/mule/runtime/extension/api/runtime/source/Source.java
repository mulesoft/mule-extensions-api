/**
 * Base class to write message sources compliant with a given {@link SourceModel}.
 * <p>
 * This class acts as an adapter between the extensions API representation of a message source
 * and Mule's actual MessageSource concept.
 * <p>
 * This class relies on generics to specify the payload and attribute types that the source
 * is going to generate. Although the java compiler does allow for raw uses of the class,
 * this API forbids that since those generics are needed for metadata purposes. For the case
 * of Sources which don't generate a response, the {@code Payload} is to be assigned to
 * {@link Void}.
 * <p>
 * If the source emits responses back to a client, then it must be annotated with
 * {@link EmitsResponse}. Notice that although such annotation is required, the mere
 * fact of using that annotation doesn't make the source automatically send the response,
 * that logic must be coded on each source.
 * <p>
 * Implementations can contain methods annotated with {@link OnSuccess} and/or {@link OnError}
 * to listen for the results of processing the generated messages. As specified, on the javadoc
 * of those annotations, the annotated methods support parameter resolution just like the operations
 * do. If the source is also annotated with {@link EmitsResponse}, these methods will be very useful
 * to actually sending those responses. Notice however, that you can still have these methods and
 * perform actions other than emitting responses if needed.
 *
 * @param <T> the generic type for the generated message's payload
 * @param <A> the generic type for the generated message's attributes
 * @since 1.0
