/**
 * Stereotype annotation to mark that one or more operations are validators.
 * <p>
 * Any operation reached by this annotation must:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Have a void return type</li>
 * <li>Declare that it throws at least one Error which is {@link MuleErrors#VALIDATION} or has it as parent</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This annotation can either be used at the method level (signaling that the stereotype applies to that specific operation)
 * or to the class level (signaling that all operations in that class have that stereotype, unless overridden by a particular
 * operation).
