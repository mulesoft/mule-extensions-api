/**
 * Specifies packages that an extension should expose beyond the default {@link ClassLoader} isolation.
 * <p>
 * This annotation's usage is optional. This annotation's purpose is to allow access to classes that are not part of the public
 * extension's API in border cases. Using this annotation should not be something usual. When needed, this annotation should be
 * placed on the same class that is annotated with {@link Extension}
 * <p>
 * The referenced packages will be visible only by the listed artifacts.<b>USE WITH CARE</b>, negligent use of this annotation
 * could result in class path issues when exported classes conflict with those in the runtime or other extensions consuming the
 * referenced packages.
